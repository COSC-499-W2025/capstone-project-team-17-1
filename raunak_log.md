### WEEK 4 PERSONAL LOG 
(Sep 22–28, 2025)
- Helped teammates **Nade** and **Shuyu** with GitHub Kanban setup, including the pull request “**Create Project Directory Structure #15.**”  
- Initiated the Group Project Proposal document by referencing the sample template provided on Canvas. Made progress on the "COSC 499 Week 4 Project Proposal" with **Michelle**, making sure that we both followed the slides.  
- While drafting the Project Scope and Usage Scenario, I introduced the idea of comparing our dashboard’s progress indicators to Workday’s percentage tracker for degree completion. This analogy made the concept easier to understand and gave the team a clear, relatable way to explain how our system shows progress toward goals.  
- Worked with **Michelle** on the System Architecture Diagram Document along with the designs following the templates on the weekly slides.  
- Reviewed **Nade**'s pull requests.

### WEEK 5 PERSONAL LOG 
(Sep 29-Oct 05, 2025)
- Worked with **Michelle** and **Parsa** to understand the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) requirements as outlined in Dr. Hui’s lecture slides. (They helped me understand what is expected on the dfd diagram in more detail.)
  - Reviewed examples of Level 0 (Context Diagram) and Level 1 (System Diagram) to learn how to properly represent processes, data stores, and external entities.
  - Collaboratively designed the Level 0 and Level 1 DFD for our Mining Digital Work Artifacts system using Google Drawings, ensuring consistency between both levels.
  - Defined the key entities (User, System API) and internal processes (Source Selection, Mining/Scan, Analytics & Generation, Visualization & Export, Save Portfolio).
  - Mapped each process to its corresponding requirement:
     - UR-01 (Source Selection) = Source Selection process
     - UR-02 (Transparency) and UR-03 (Progress & Feedback) = feedback flows within Mining/Scan
     - UR-04 (Control) and UR-05 (Privacy) = user interactions that manage or limit scanning
     - UR-06 (Insights) = Analytics & Generation
     - UR-07 (Export) = Visualization & Export
     - UR-08 (Accessibility) = consistent flow design and labeling for screen-reader compatibility
- ***(I had previously worked on the user requirements section on the **Project Requirements** document)***
- Feedback emphasized improving clarity within labels and showing how progress updates (UR-03) interact with the user interface and error logs.
- No unresolved problems this week — most questions were clarified during in-class discussions by reviewing other teams’ DFD diagrams. Our group was able to solve the remaining issues collaboratively during team meetings, which helped us further polish our DFD diagram.
- Further steps I participated in: polishing flow labels, incorporate progress-feedback details (from in class discussions) into the final DFD, and prepare for the DFD quiz.
