### 2. Weekly Goals Recap
- discussed the basic construction of the app with team and completed the Level 0 and Level 1 DFD.
- Asssgin members to their tasks

This week, our team worked together to discuss the basic construction and overall design of the Data Mining App. We mainly focused on how the data flows between the user, system modules, and external APIs, and made sure everyone understood the boundaries and responsibilities of each part. Through the discussion, we reached a clear and shared understanding of how user input, data mining, analysis, and output generation will connect in the system.

During this process, we also completed both the Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to better visualize how the system works.

The Level 0 DFD gives a simple, high-level view of the system. It shows how the User interacts with the Data Mining App and the System API, focusing on the main data exchanges like authentication, data mining requests, and output generation.

The Level 1 DFD goes deeper into the system’s internal logic. It breaks down the app into smaller processes such as Source Selection, Mining/Scan, Analytics & Metrics Generation, Visualization & Export, and Save Portfolio. It also includes data stores like the Artifact Database and Portfolio Database, showing how information is saved and used. Feedback loops such as Error Logs and Export Logs are also included to keep track of system performance and ensure accuracy.

These diagrams helped us clearly see how different parts of the app connect and will serve as a guide for the next development steps.
