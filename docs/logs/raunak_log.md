### WEEK 4 PERSONAL LOG 
(Sep 22–28, 2025)
- Helped teammates **Nade** and **Shuyu** with GitHub Kanban setup, including the pull request “**Create Project Directory Structure #15.**”  
- Initiated the Group Project Proposal document by referencing the sample template provided on Canvas. Made progress on the "COSC 499 Week 4 Project Proposal" with **Michelle**, making sure that we both followed the slides.  
- While drafting the Project Scope and Usage Scenario, I introduced the idea of comparing our dashboard’s progress indicators to Workday’s percentage tracker for degree completion. This analogy made the concept easier to understand and gave the team a clear, relatable way to explain how our system shows progress toward goals.  
- Worked with **Michelle** on the System Architecture Diagram Document along with the designs following the templates on the weekly slides.  
- Reviewed **Nade**'s pull requests.
