The document proposes a local first app that mines a userâ€™s own files to help them understand and showcase their work history. It targets students and early professionals who want clear timelines, trends, and portfolio style summaries without sending data off the device. In scope are scanning chosen folders, classifying common file types, deduplicating with strong hashes, storing results in a local data store, and presenting dashboards plus simple exports. Users control what is scanned, can pause or resume, and see transparent previews and progress with errors surfaced. Typical use cases include presentations, reviews, resumes, and quick retrospectives.

Functionally, the system lets a user pick sources, crawls and classifies artifacts, builds searchable indexes and filters by time, type, project, and path, and produces insights like activity timelines and type distributions. Non functional goals stress fast setup, efficient and resumable scans, responsiveness, accessibility, and strong privacy and security. Data stays local with least privilege, encrypted storage using the operating system keystore, a localhost only API with per session tokens, secure deletion, and redaction of sensitive patterns in cached snippets. Maintainability expectations include straightforward developer setup, high automated test coverage, pinned dependencies, signed releases, and clear documentation.

For an initial milestone, the team should ship source selection, common type detection, hashing into SQLite with indexes, a live progress bar with pause and resume, basic dashboards for timeline and type distribution, search and filters, delete from index, a minimal local API, and CSV or JSON export with a preview. Success looks like accurate classification for most common types, a medium scan that completes within minutes on a typical laptop, common interactions that respond within a couple of seconds, and users reporting that the visualizations improve their understanding of their work. Key risks are privacy leaks, interruptions, and performance slowdowns, addressed by on device processing with redaction, checkpoint and resume, and resource caps with a light scan mode.
