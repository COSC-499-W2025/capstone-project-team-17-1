## WEEK 6 TEAM LOG
(Oct 6 - Oct 12, 2025)

### Recap of Milestone Goal - Week 6

In Week 6, our team reviewed all project artifacts, including every diagram, the requirements document, the Project Proposal, and the WBS, to ensure consistency and completeness. We finished setting up the local development environment and configured Docker for a reproducible build and run process. We also initialized the repository structure, documented setup steps, and agreed on coding conventions. Development began with the core logic: we wrote the initial, non-GUI modules and command line entry points, added basic tests to verify functionality, and confirmed that everything builds and runs successfully in Docker.

### Test Report Week 6

During Week 6, the team conducted focused testing on two functional requirements: #23 Store User Configurations for Future Use and #19 Return an Error if the Specified File is in the Wrong Format. The objective was to verify that user preferences can be properly saved and reloaded across sessions, and that the system correctly identifies and handles invalid file inputs. For #23, tests confirmed that user configurations were successfully stored and reloaded upon restarting the application, ensuring persistence of settings such as directory paths and consent options. For #19, the system was tested with multiple non-zip files, including .pdf, .jpg, and .exe, and consistently returned the expected standardized error response in JSON format. Both functionalities performed as intended, with only a minor delay observed during configuration reload, and were marked as passed.

### Test Report Week 7

During Week 7, the team closed five issues: **#39** finalized the tech stack (Electron/Node/TypeScript) with scripts and a bootable skeleton; **#38** implemented heuristics to distinguish individual vs. collaborative projects and exposed the labels in filters; **#21** delivered the consent/settings UI with choices persisted across sessions; **#20** completed core ZIP parsing via a streaming iterator that emits normalized entries, with upload-flow integration tracked next; and **#49** triaged the upload bug—non-ZIP paths are stable and return standardized JSON via `fileValidator.js`, while ZIP uploads still surface “iterZipMetadata is not a function” until #20 is wired into the upload pipeline.

### Test Report Week 8
During Week 8, the team focused on advancing core analysis capabilities and improving application usability across multiple modules. **#56 (Collaboration Analysis Module)** introduced logic to detect co-authorship patterns, review-based interactions, shared accounts, and configurable weight normalization. The implementation was validated through automated tests (`TestA–TestC`) and CSV formatting checks (`TestD`), confirming robustness even on empty repositories. **#58** enhanced frontend usability by polishing layout components, improving visual consistency, and adding a custom application icon to our Electron build, making the application feel more production-ready. **#59 (Feature: Extract Key Skills)** delivered contributor skill detection with adjustable filters and export features; manual and automated tests confirmed skill attribution accuracy and CSV export structure. Finally, **#63** enabled persistent data storage by integrating SQLite through Electron `userData`, with schema auto-loading and IPC support, verified via database initialization logs and table inspection. Overall, this week transitioned the system from isolated features toward an integrated analysis pipeline with data persistence, collaboration metrics, and user-facing analytics.

### Test Report Week 9
During Week 9, the team focused on strengthening backend intelligence, expanding test coverage, and advancing the system’s full Python migration. #72 introduced a weighted ranking algorithm that evaluates projects by contribution metrics, validated through tests and manual demo archives; #73 delivered a granular consent mechanism requiring explicit user authorization for external data sharing, verified via automated and CLI workflows; #74 added a `clean` subcommand to safely remove generated outputs with both unit and manual tests confirming correct directory handling; and #76 implemented safe insight deletion with comprehensive unittest coverage for refcount blocking, cascade dry-run, purge safety, audit trail, and soft-delete restoration. Together, these updates enhanced reliability, user control, and the consistency of Python-based backend operations.
