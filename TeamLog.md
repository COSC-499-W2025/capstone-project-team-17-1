## WEEK 6 TEAM LOG
(Oct 6 - Oct 12, 2025)

### Recap of Milestone Goal - Week 6

In Week 6, our team reviewed all project artifacts, including every diagram, the requirements document, the Project Proposal, and the WBS, to ensure consistency and completeness. We finished setting up the local development environment and configured Docker for a reproducible build and run process. We also initialized the repository structure, documented setup steps, and agreed on coding conventions. Development began with the core logic: we wrote the initial, non-GUI modules and command line entry points, added basic tests to verify functionality, and confirmed that everything builds and runs successfully in Docker.

### Test Report Week 6

During Week 6, the team conducted focused testing on two functional requirements: #23 Store User Configurations for Future Use and #19 Return an Error if the Specified File is in the Wrong Format. The objective was to verify that user preferences can be properly saved and reloaded across sessions, and that the system correctly identifies and handles invalid file inputs. For #23, tests confirmed that user configurations were successfully stored and reloaded upon restarting the application, ensuring persistence of settings such as directory paths and consent options. For #19, the system was tested with multiple non-zip files, including .pdf, .jpg, and .exe, and consistently returned the expected standardized error response in JSON format. Both functionalities performed as intended, with only a minor delay observed during configuration reload, and were marked as passed.
